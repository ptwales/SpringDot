About:
	Initially designed to solve a system of differential equations describing the equations of motion for a unique three body problem for my IS.  The goal now is implement object orientation to abstract the solver from the particular system.
	The initial project was not developed from the ground up to object oriented or fully abstracted from the system; although some designs were made with that in mind during the process.  
	Current version includes a 
GOALS (In order:)
	Iterative Method "Engine" (Direct Methods shouldn't need this)
		Extend to different problems Boundry, initial value, ODE, PDE etc..
			Have methods for problems, etc PDEengine, then Euler, EulerCromer, RungeKutta, etc
	Unix commandline flags for Engine?

	GUI plotter for solutions
		Have an abstract(?) solution Graph class
			Add basic graphic classes to it, allow users to extend for more.
		Error and Performance Analysis


	Parameter space plotter (Bread and butter)
		Output to SQL?
		Unix command flags.
		Other uses?
