Numerical Method Library for developing programs for computational programming. Based on code from my Senior Thesis, except this time it will be OO from the start.

About:
GOALS (In order:)
	Three Class trees, { System, Method, Storage }
		All in namespaces { problem, solution, answer }

		First, build with what I am familiar with, system of PDE's, just to confirm it works, then build from the bottom up.

	System
		It is mandatory that the user extends an existing subclass and use that instead.
		User defines needed fields and methods.
		Example: Spring
			System -> Differential Equation -> { Ordinary, Hamiltonian } -> user extended
	
	Method
		Method's available are determined by the class of system used by composition.

	Storage
		determined by composition of the Method

Applications

	GUI plotter for solutions
		Have an abstract(?) solution Graph class
			Add basic graphic classes to it, allow users to extend for more.
		Error and Performance Analysis


	Parameter space plotter (Bread and butter)
		Output to SQL?
		Unix command flags.
		Other uses?
